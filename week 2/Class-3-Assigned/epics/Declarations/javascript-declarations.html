    Create a new JavaScript file to practice the concepts you've picked up.

    <br /><br />
    Write a minimum of three distinct functions:<br /><br />
    A no-parameter function displaying a greeting.

    <br /><br />
    A function accepting a name as its parameter to show a personalized
    greeting. <br /><br />

    A function taking two numbers as parameters, returning their sum.

    <br /><br />Execute your functions to ascertain they operate as anticipated.
    <br /><br />
    After you've wrapped up your exercises, commit the JavaScript file to a
    GitHub repository. This not only helps in tracking your progress but also
    offers a platform to share your code when necessary.
