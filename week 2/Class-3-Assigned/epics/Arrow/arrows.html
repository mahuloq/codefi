      Construct a new JavaScript file for practicing the newly acquired
      concepts. <br />
      <br />
      Script a minimum of three arrow functions:<br />
      <br />
      A function that accepts two arguments and returns their product.<br />
      <br />
      A function that takes in a string and returns it in uppercase. <br />
      <br />
      A function with a single parameter, calculating the square of the provided
      number. <br />
      <br />
      Validate the proper functioning of your functions. Upon completion, push
      your JavaScript file to a GitHub repository to maintain a record and
      possibly share with others when needed.
